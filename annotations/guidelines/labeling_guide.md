# Labeling Guide (v0.1)

This task uses **operational labels**.
Annotators should avoid psychological attributions.

## Purpose
Purpose = the functional goal inferred from immediate context and utterance.
Always provide short evidence grounded in context.

Examples:
- requesting (ask for an object/action)
- protesting (reject/avoid)
- informing (share information)
- social-connection (greet/engage)
- self-regulation (soothe/escape)

## Behavior
Behavior = what was observed (speech/gesture/motor/mixed).

## Alignment
- aligned: behavior plausibly supports the inferred purpose
- misaligned: behavior contradicts or fails to support the inferred purpose
- uncertain: not enough evidence or multiple plausible interpretations
