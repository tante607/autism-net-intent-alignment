# Purpose–Behavior Alignment for ASD Interaction Scenarios

This repository contains a minimal, research-first project to define and evaluate a **purpose–behavior alignment** task in ASD interaction contexts.

## What is the task?

Given an utterance and its interaction context, the task is to:
1. infer the **functional purpose**
2. identify the **observed behavior**
3. decide whether the behavior **aligns** with the inferred purpose

## Scope (v0.1)

- Focus: task definition + simple interpretable baselines
- Not included: raw data, clinical diagnosis, or any production system

## Repository structure

- `docs/` — problem statement and task definition
- `src/` — baseline code (minimal and readable)
- `data/` — instructions only (no raw data)

## Quick start

> Coming soon

## Data

This repo does not ship raw data.
See `data/README.md` for how to place your own processed examples.

## Baseline

A simple baseline will be implemented in `src/baseline.py`.
