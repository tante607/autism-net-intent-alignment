# Overview

## Problem
In ASD interaction scenarios, a child's observed behavior does not always align with the functional purpose inferred from context.
This work studies purpose–behavior alignment as a computational task.

## Task Definition
Given an utterance and its interaction context, the task is to:
- infer the functional purpose
- identify the observed behavior
- determine whether the behavior aligns with the inferred purpose

## Contribution
1. Define a purpose–behavior alignment task for ASD interaction analysis
2. Provide a simple and interpretable baseline
3. Establish a reproducible evaluation setup
